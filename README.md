# EDA
Building a machine learning model for the company to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default so that the company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

# Problem Statement
The Loan-providing companies find it hard to give loans to people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it to their advantage by becoming defaulters. Suppose you work for a consumer finance company that specializes in lending various types of loans to urban customers. You have to use EDA to analyze the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are accepted.
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide on loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is expected to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

This case study aims to identify patterns that indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of the loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are accepted. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
